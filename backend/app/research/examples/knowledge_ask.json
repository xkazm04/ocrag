  "question": "What was the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Les Wexner?",
  "answer": "Based on the available evidence, Jeffrey Epstein had an extensive financial and personal relationship with Les Wexner spanning from the late 1980s until 2007. Wexner granted Epstein broad power of attorney over his financial affairs, and Epstein managed significant portions of Wexner's wealth. Epstein received his Manhattan townhouse from Wexner, and served as a trustee for Wexner's charitable foundation. The relationship appears to have ended around 2007 following Epstein's initial legal troubles in Florida.",
