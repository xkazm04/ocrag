# Domain Credibility Configuration
# Scores range from 0.0 (untrusted) to 1.0 (highly trusted)
#
# This file can be customized per deployment to adjust credibility scoring
# for domain authority, source type classification, and scoring weights.

# Domain authority scores for known domains
# TLD patterns start with "." and match any domain ending with that suffix
# Specific domains are matched exactly or as suffix (for subdomains)
